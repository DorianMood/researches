# Literature review

Currently graph neural nets are able to take into account only k-hop neighbors. But it's clear that this approach can be quite unfair. In [@wang_atpgnn_2021] authors built such an architecture that it can consider both local k-hop neighbors structure and distant nodes that are located in similar topological context. What do they do is basically perform three independent and completely different embedding procedures (discussed below) and then make a decision based on the embeddings results.

The vast majority of works in the sphere is about some general type of graphs. However there are some works [@jin_predicting_2021] about bipartite graphs. Bipartite graph is just a graph that has two node sets. Nodes can be different types, then we also call it heterogeneous. In considered paper authors apply graph learning algorithm on Tokyo emergency infrastructure data. They separate the data on two types regions and hospitals each has its own features, then do a binary classification to predict whether the system can handle a difficult situation and what are the weakest elements.

# 1. ATPGNN: Reconstruction of Neighborhood in Graph Neural Networks With Attention-Based Topological Patterns

First let me show their architecture [@fig:atpgnn_architecture]. Knowing general idea it would be easier to explain all the deep concepts.

![ATPGNN architecture](atpgnn_architecture.png){#fig:atpgnn_architecture}

Let me start from the output of the algorithm then going to the input. There is an attention layer, similar to GAT [@Velickovic2017], but having three different attention mechanism. The first is feature attention [@eq:atpgnn_feature_attention]. Feature attention doesn't differ from GAT really much.

$$
e^l_{i,j}=\delta([W^l\vec{h}^l_i||W^l\vec{h}^l_j]),v_j\in N_i
$${#eq:atpgnn_feature_attention}

Where $\vec{h}^0_i=\vec{x}^T_i$ and $\vec{h}^0_j=\vec{x}^T_j$.

Next is topology attention [@eq:atpgnn_topology_attention], which contains information about remote similar nodes information.

$$
f^l_{i,j}=\delta([W^{l}\vec{p}^l_i||W^l\vec{p}^l_j]),v_i\in N_i
$${#eq:atpgnn_topology_attention}

Where $\vec{p}^0_i=\vec{s}^T_i$ is a representation of remote node with similar structure, obtained by independently performed message passing.

Let me explain this message passing meaning. We do it to obtain structural information of node local neighborhood, and then it's easy to find nodes with similar representation. In case of linear data structure (here we have just node embedding list) it's a trivial task.

The final formula of convolution is [@eq:atpgnn_convolution]

$$
\vec{h}^l_i=concatenate^K_{k=1}(\sigma(\sum_{v_j\in N_i}A^{k(l-1)}_{i,j}W^{k(l-1)}\vec{h}^{l-1}_j))
$${@eq:atpgnn_convolution}

Here $A$ is graph representation obtained by combining previously mentioned attentions.

Generally speaking concatenation is used in case when we need to separate some groups of features from each other.

Architecture is quite interesting. They combine several architecture to obtain something new. The results [@fig:atpgnn_results], however, are just a little better then plain GCN.

![ATPGNN results](atpgnn_results.png){#fig:atpgnn_results}

We can see that they perform slightly better then just plain architecture. I think in some domains this architecture is applicable and can be used as an example of complex GNN architecture.

# 2. Predicting Emergency Medical Service Demand with Bipartite Graph Convolutional Networks

Let me start by defining a problem. They have a database containing a statistics on Tokyo emergency data. Each hospital can give an information about past emergency cases. Some data on patients age, gender ambulance type, date, hospital address etc. and some hospital characteristics like capacity. Each region aso has similar data on injury cases, injured citizens data etc.

They build a bipartite graph [@fig:bigcn_graph] based on data mentioned above.

![Hospital / Region emergency cases graph](bigcn_graph.png){#fig:bigcn_graph}

It is clear that applying a GNN or GNN we won't get any adequate results. Graph structure is too specific [@eq:bigcn_adjacency_matrix_structure].

$$
A=\begin{bmatrix}
  0_{M\times M} & B_u \\
  B_v & 0_{N\times N}\\
\end{bmatrix}
$${#eq:bigcn_adjacency_matrix_structure}

Where $B_u$ and $B_v$ are adjacency matrixes for hospital nodes $u\in U$ and for regions $v\in V$ and other elements are zeros because we know the graph is bipartite (node from $U$ can only be connected to node from $V$ and opposite).

So, we can also think of feature matrix as shown in [@eq:bigcn_feature_matrix].

$$
H^{(0)}=\begin{bmatrix}
  F_u & | & 0_{M\times(Q-P)} \\
   & & F_u \\ 
\end{bmatrix}
$${#eq:bigcn_feature_matrix}

Where $F_u$ and $F_v$ are features are corresponding initial features of $U$ and $V$ nodes subsets. $M$, $Q$ and $P$ are number of hospital nodes, number of region features, number of hospital features.

![BIGCN architecture](bigcn_architecture.png){#fig:bigcn_architecture}

Purposed architecture is shown on [@fig:bigcn_architecture]. Here we can see that there are two flows, for each part of bipartite graph. 

And finlay all we need now is just to set up a propagation rule which is in [@eq:bigcn_propagation_rule]. Here I put only rule for half of the network (remind we have a bipartite graph with two types of nodes, so propagation is implementing in two flows running in parallel). A formula for $V$ flow is down here.

$$
H^{(t+1)}_v=\sigma([D^{-1}_vB_vH^{(t)}_vW^{(t+1)_v}||F_v\omega^{(t+1)}_v])
$${#eq:bigcn_propagation rule}

Where $D^{-1}$ is ... and $\omega$ is ....

Results are surprisingly good. They acheaved in some runs more then 90% accuracy for their database.
