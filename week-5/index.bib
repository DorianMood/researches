	abstract = {Trafﬁc forecasting is a particularly challenging application of spatiotemporal forecasting, due to the time-varying trafﬁc patterns and the complicated spatial dependencies on road networks. To address this challenge, we learn the trafﬁc network as a graph and propose a novel deep learning framework, Trafﬁc Graph Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory Neural Network (TGC-LSTM), to learn the interactions between roadways in the trafﬁc network and forecast the network-wide trafﬁc state. We deﬁne the trafﬁc graph convolution based on the physical network topology. The relationship between the proposed trafﬁc graph convolution and the spectral graph convolution is also discussed. An L1-norm on graph convolution weights and an L2-norm on graph convolution features are added to the model’s loss function to enhance the interpretability of the proposed model. Experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms baseline methods on two real-world trafﬁc state datasets. The visualization of the graph convolution weights indicates that the proposed framework can recognize the most inﬂuential road segments in real-world trafﬁc networks.},

	abstract = {Action recognition with skeleton data is attracting more attention in computer vision. Recently, graph convolutional networks (GCNs), which model the human body skeletons as spatiotemporal graphs, have obtained remarkable performance. However, the computational complexity of GCNbased methods are pretty heavy, typically over 15 GFLOPs for one action sample. Recent works even reach ∼100 GFLOPs. Another shortcoming is that the receptive ﬁelds of both spatial graph and temporal graph are inﬂexible. Although some works enhance the expressiveness of spatial graph by introducing incremental adaptive modules, their performance is still limited by regular GCN structures. In this paper, we propose a novel shift graph convolutional network (Shift-GCN) to overcome both shortcomings. Instead of using heavy regular graph convolutions, our Shift-GCN is composed of novel shift graph operations and lightweight point-wise convolutions, where the shift graph operations provide ﬂexible receptive ﬁelds for both spatial graph and temporal graph. On three datasets for skeleton-based action recognition, the proposed Shift-GCN notably exceeds the state-of-the-art methods with more than 10× less computational complexity.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes a framework to analyse trafﬁc-data processes on a long-haul backbone infrastructure network providing internet services at a national level. This type of network requires low latency and fast speed, which means there is a large demand for research focusing on near real-time decision-making and resilience assessment. To this aim, this paper proposes two innovative, complementary procedures: a multi-view approach for the topology analysis of a backbone network at a static level and a time-series mining approach of the graph signal for modelling the trafﬁc dynamics. The combined framework provides a deeper understanding of a backbone network than classical models, allowing for backbone network optimisation operations and management at near real-time. This methodology was applied to the backbone infrastructure of a major UK internet service provider. Doing so increased accuracy and computational efﬁciency for detecting where and when anomalies and pattern irregularities occur in the network signal.},

	abstract = {Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been applied in many ﬁelds of semi-supervised node classiﬁcation for non-Euclidean data. However, some GNNs cannot make good use of positive information brought by nodes which are far away from each central node for aggregation operations. These remote nodes with positive information can enhance the representation of the central node. Some GNNs also ignore rich structure information around each central node’s surroundings or entire network. Besides, most of GNNs have a ﬁxed architecture and cannot change their components to adapt to different tasks. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised learning platform ATPGNN with three variable components to overcome the above shortcomings. This novel model can fully adapt to different tasks by changing its components and support inductive learning. The key idea is that we ﬁrst create a high-order topology graph, which is from similarity of node structure information. Speciﬁcally, we reconstruct the relationships between nodes in a potential space obtained by network embedding in graph. Second, we introduce graph representation learning methods to extract representation information of remote nodes on the high-order topology graph. Third, we use some network embedding methods to get graph structure information of each node. Finally, we combine the representation information of remote nodes, graph structure information and feature for each node by attention mechanism, and apply them to learning node representation in graph. Extensive experiments on real attributed networks demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model against traditional GNNs.},

	abstract = {Emergency medical service (EMS) plays an essential role in increasing survival rates as it provides ﬁrst aid to victims of life-threatening emergencies. However, unbalanced EMS supply-demand distribution in the metropolis may cause a shortage of accessible EMS resources and delay the ﬁrst aid treatment. There is an urgent need to discover the hidden EMS supply-demand relation, predict the incoming EMS demand, and take precautions against unexpected emergencies. This study assumes that EMS demand correlates with population demographic data, regional socioeconomic factors, and hospital conditions. To model these correlated factors, we represent Tokyo’s ambulance record data as a hospital-region bipartite graph and propose a bipartite graph convolutional neural network model to predict the EMS demand between hospital-region pairs. Our approach achieves 77.3\% − 87.7\% accuracy in binary demand label prediction task. It signiﬁcantly outperforms traditional machine learning algorithms, statistical models, and the latest graph-based methods. Finally, we use a case study to show the signiﬁcance ofEMS demand forecasting, proving that our approach can contribute to public health emergency management by making EMS predictions.},

	abstract = {Rumor detection is an important research topic in social networks, and lots of rumor detection models are proposed in recent years. For the rumor detection task, structural information in a conversation can be used to extract effective features. However, many existing rumor detection models focus on local structural features while the global structural features between the source tweet and its replies are not effectively used. To make full use of global structural features and content information, we propose SourceReplies relation Graph (SR-graph) for each conversation, in which every node denotes a tweet, its node feature is weighted word vectors, and edges denote the interaction between tweets. Based on SR-graphs, we propose an Ensemble Graph Convolutional Neural Net with a Nodes Proportion Allocation Mechanism (EGCN) for the rumor detection task. In experiments, we ﬁrst verify that the extracted structural features are effective, and then we show the effects of different word-embedding dimensions on multiple test indices. Moreover, we show that our proposed EGCN model is comparable or even better than the current state-of-art machine learning models.},
