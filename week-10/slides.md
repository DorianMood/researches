# Scene graphs

Scene graph is a representation of an image or a video that reflects an underlying structure of a scene.

---

# Scene graph example

<div class="twocols">

![](scene-graph.png)

<p class="break"></p>

## This graph:
- Reflects relations between objects
- Can be a source of spatial knowledge
- Should be expressed formally on some human language

</div>

# Scene graph generation

1. Object detection. On this step primary detection happens. Objects and their bounding boxes are extracted.
2. Object-relation-subject SGG triplets are constructed from primary detected objects.
3. One from the variety of Scene Graph Generation (SGG) algorithms is applied.

---

# 1. Object recognition

<div class="twocols">

![](object-detection.png)

<p class="break"></p>

On this step one of the existing object detection algorithms is used. By the end of this step we have a detected object and bounding boxes list.

</div>

---

# 2. Object-relation-subject triplets generation

<div class="twocols">

![](subject-relation-object.png)

<p class="break"></p>

The recognized objects are grouped to form a list of <subject, relation, object> triplets.
Those triplets can be filtered to get rid of not important objects or relations.

</div>

# 3. SGG

<div class="twocols">

<p class="break"></p>

This is the final step where Scene Graph Generation happens. This step is fully customizable and we can use whatever algorithm we want, such as message passing networks, CNN, RNN/LSTM etc.

# Scene graph generation models

There are many different approaches to deal with the initial detected objects such as:

1. Using CNN to derive a relation for object-relation-subject triplets from *visual* appearance.
2. Using RNN/LSTM to to derive a relation from visual features and smoothing it by many steps.
3. Using message passing and GNN to learn relation from primary graph.

However I here we will mostly cover Graph network connected methods.

---

# CNN architecture example

Visual and Language modules are employed to generate the final graph. Mainly this method is based on mapping visual features on graph and language.

---

# RNN/LSTM architecture example

Subject, object and relation features are extracted and dimension are reduced. Then recursive propagation is being applied.

![](rnn.png)

---

# GNN architecture example

Fully-connected graph is constructed, then unnecessary edges are pruned and graph convolution is applied on sparse graph to learn graph contextual features, such as relations from our triplets.

# Applications of Scene graph

The next step is to apply scene graph to benefit from it. Down below are some of the variants listed:

1. Captioning.
2. Generation.
3. Image retrieval.
4. Visual question answering.
5. Image understanding.
6. 3d Scene generation.
7. Human-object-interaction.

# Conclusion

Scene graph extraction can be performed differently, but the main pipeline has been described in this presentation (Page 7).

Scene graph is a compressed representation of given image, which contains a meaningful information about image.

Scene graphs can be used in a wide variety of tasks connected to understanding some image or video.

# Afterword

Scene graph generation for image compression (take a look on existing papers)
Application niche and scenario, motivation.

Prepare different application variants and scenarios, how and where exactly we can use it.

Compare scene graph and JPEG sizes.
