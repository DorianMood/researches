# Introduction

Nowadays there are many existing image compression approaches. We can divide such algorithms in two groups: lossy and lossless (list them here). Both has beed developed for decades already. There is a certain trend to apply a power of neural networks in compression domain. First approaches were (link here first publications), where authors proved that we can use one neural network to generate a compressed representation of an image and another neural network to restore initial image from its representation generated by first network. Now such networks are also being used to solve an image and video upscale tasks.

For now a general approach is to encode an image to compressed representation using convolutional neural network and take the convolutional features from one of the top layers of network. In this work author is going to use a slightly different architecture. There were many publications connected to graph convolution in recent years. Early publications introduced a graph convolution, later the main approaches had been formed. It is important to mention that even though the first application were obviously connected to graph classification () and graph clustering (), in recent years application domain has been extended to action recognition (), supply-demand prediction (), time series prediction (), traffic and wind prediction () and many others.

In this work author is going to use existing graph convolution algorithms to generate a representation of an image that takes less space and can be transported or stored more effectively. The core of this framework is scene graph representation of an image.

# Project statement

The first question is how do we memorize some image or visual scene in our life. We do not operate in terms of pixels or object coordinates. More likely we use something like scheme, which describes the most important parts of an image as it shown on [@fig:image_and_scene_graph].

![Image and scene graph associated with it](Image%20and%20scene%20graph.png){#fig:image_and_scene_graph}

The scene graph represented on the figure above is simplified, real graph can also have node attributes different from just an object label, for example in case of hair we can also attach an attribute "brown" and "curly".

There are algorithms that can extract a scene graph from an image. There were some approaches to generate image based on scene graph. So the idea is quite obvious: let us combine those two algorithms to build a compression algorithm prototype. From general point of view we can see such algorithm as an autoencoder with Scene Graph Generation network as encoder and Scene Graph to Image network as decoder.

# Contributions

The contribution of this work can be considered from two major perspective. The first is that this work is going to be the first try to use scene graph as a compressed representation of an image. From the second perspective author is going to use a general autoencoder architecture with meaningful graph structure as a representation.
