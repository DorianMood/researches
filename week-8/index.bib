  abstractnote = {In this work we investigate the effect of the convolutional network depth on its accuracy in the large-scale image recognition setting. Our main contribution is a thorough evaluation of networks of increasing depth using an architecture with very small (3x3) convolution filters, which shows that a significant improvement on the prior-art configurations can be achieved by pushing the depth to 16-19 weight layers. These findings were the basis of our ImageNet Challenge 2014 submission, where our team secured the first and the second places in the localisation and classification tracks respectively. We also show that our representations generalise well to other datasets, where they achieve state-of-the-art results. We have made our two best-performing ConvNet models publicly available to facilitate further research on the use of deep visual representations in computer vision.},

To reduce overﬁtting in the fully-connected layers we employed a recently-developed regularization method called “dropout” that proved to be very effective.

We present a residual learning framework to ease the training of networks that are substantially deeper than those used previously. We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers---8x deeper than VGG nets but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57% error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks. Solely due to our extremely deep representations, we obtain a 28% relative improvement on the COCO object detection dataset. Deep residual nets are foundations of our submissions to ILSVRC & COCO 2015 competitions, where we also won the 1st places on the tasks of ImageNet detection, ImageNet localization, COCO detection, and COCO segmentation.},

We theoretically analyze the resulting linear model and show that it corresponds to a fixed low-pass filter followed by a linear classifier. Notably, our experimental evaluation demonstrates that these simplifications do not negatively impact accuracy in many downstream applications.

In contrast to related approaches that filter in the spectral domain, the proposed method aggregates features purely in the spatial domain. In addition, SplineCNN allows entire end-to-end training of deep architectures, using only the geometric structure as input, instead of handcrafted feature descriptors.

  abstractnote = {Capsule Networks, as alternatives to Convolutional Neural Networks, have been proposed to recognize objects from images. The current literature demonstrates many advantages of CapsNets over CNNs. However, how to create explanations for individual classifications of CapsNets has not been well explored. The widely used saliency methods are mainly proposed for explaining CNN-based classifications; they create saliency map explanations by combining activation values and the corresponding gradients, e.g., Grad-CAM. These saliency methods require a specific architecture of the underlying classifiers and cannot be trivially applied to CapsNets due to the iterative routing mechanism therein. To overcome the lack of interpretability, we can either propose new post-hoc interpretation methods for CapsNets or modifying the model to have build-in explanations. In this work, we explore the latter. Specifically, we propose interpretable Graph Capsule Networks (GraCapsNets), where we replace the routing part with a multi-head attention-based Graph Pooling approach. In the proposed model, individual classification explanations can be created effectively and efficiently. Our model also demonstrates some unexpected benefits, even though it replaces the fundamental part of CapsNets. Our GraCapsNets achieve better classification performance with fewer parameters and better adversarial robustness, when compared to CapsNets. Besides, GraCapsNets also keep other advantages of CapsNets, namely, disentangled representations and affine transformation robustness.},

Here we present GraphSAGE, a general inductive framework that leverages node feature information (e.g., text attributes) to efficiently generate node embeddings for previously unseen data. Instead of training individual embeddings for each node, we learn a function that generates embeddings by sampling and aggregating features from a node’s local neighborhood. Our algorithm outperforms strong baselines on three inductive node-classification benchmarks: we classify the category of unseen nodes in evolving information graphs based on citation and Reddit post data, and we show that our algorithm generalizes to completely unseen graphs using a multi-graph dataset of protein-protein interactions.},

Second, we introduce graph representation learning methods to extract representation information of remote nodes on the high-order topology graph.

  abstractnote = {Action recognition with skeleton data is attracting more attention in computer vision. Recently, graph convolutional networks (GCNs), which model the human body skeletons as spatiotemporal graphs, have obtained remarkable performance. However, the computational complexity of GCNbased methods are pretty heavy, typically over 15 GFLOPs for one action sample. Recent works even reach ∼100 GFLOPs. Another shortcoming is that the receptive ﬁelds of both spatial graph and temporal graph are inﬂexible. Although some works enhance the expressiveness of spatial graph by introducing incremental adaptive modules, their performance is still limited by regular GCN structures. In this paper, we propose a novel shift graph convolutional network (Shift-GCN) to overcome both shortcomings. Instead of using heavy regular graph convolutions, our Shift-GCN is composed of novel shift graph operations and lightweight point-wise convolutions, where the shift graph operations provide ﬂexible receptive ﬁelds for both spatial graph and temporal graph. On three datasets for skeleton-based action recognition, the proposed Shift-GCN notably exceeds the state-of-the-art methods with more than 10× less computational complexity.},

  abstractnote = {The explosive growth in video streaming gives rise to challenges on performing video understanding at high accuracy and low computation cost. Conventional 2D CNNs are computationally cheap but cannot capture temporal relationships; 3D CNN based methods can achieve good performance but are computationally intensive, making it expensive to deploy. In this paper, we propose a generic and effective Temporal Shift Module (TSM) that enjoys both high efficiency and high performance. Specifically, it can achieve the performance of 3D CNN but maintain 2D CNN’s complexity. TSM shifts part of the channels along the temporal dimension; thus facilitate information exchanged among neighboring frames. It can be inserted into 2D CNNs to achieve temporal modeling at zero computation and zero parameters. We also extended TSM to online setting, which enables real-time low-latency online video recognition and video object detection. TSM is accurate and efficient: it ranks the first place on the Something-Something leaderboard upon publication; on Jetson Nano and Galaxy Note8, it achieves a low latency of 13ms and 35ms for online video recognition. The code is available at: https://github.com/mit-han-lab/temporal-shift-module.},

  url          = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.06925},
  abstractnote = {Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection devotes to learn how humans interact with surrounding objects via inferring triplets of < human, verb, object >. However, recent HOI detection methods mostly rely on additional annotations (e.g., human pose) and neglect powerful interactive reasoning beyond convolutions. In this paper, we present a novel graph-based interactive reasoning model called Interactive Graph (abbr. in-Graph) to infer HOIs, in which interactive semantics implied among visual targets are efficiently exploited. The proposed model consists of a project function that maps related targets from convolution space to a graph-based semantic space, a message passing process propagating semantics among all nodes and an update function transforming the reasoned nodes back to convolution space. Furthermore, we construct a new framework to assemble in-Graph models for detecting HOIs, namely in-GraphNet. Beyond inferring HOIs using instance features respectively, the framework dynamically parses pairwise interactive semantics among visual targets by integrating two-level in-Graphs, i.e., scene-wide and instance-wide in-Graphs. Our framework is end-to-end trainable and free from costly annotations like human pose. Extensive experiments show that our proposed framework outperforms existing HOI detection methods on both V-COCO and HICO-DET benchmarks and improves the baseline about 9.4% and 15% relatively, validating its efficacy in detecting HOIs.},

  abstractnote = {Graph convolutional networks (GCN) have recently demonstrated their potential in analyzing non-grid structure data that can be represented as graphs. The core idea is to encode the local topology of a graph, via convolutions, into the feature of a center node. In this paper, we propose a novel GCN model, which we term as Shortest Path Graph Attention Network (SPAGAN). Unlike conventional GCN models that carry out node-based attentions within each layer, the proposed SPAGAN conducts path-based attention that explicitly accounts for the influence of a sequence of nodes yielding the minimum cost, or shortest path, between the center node and its higher-order neighbors. SPAGAN therefore allows for a more informative and intact exploration of the graph structure and further {a} more effective aggregation of information from distant neighbors into the center node, as compared to node-based GCN methods. We test SPAGAN on the downstream classification task on several standard datasets, and achieve performances superior to the state of the art. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/ihollywhy/SPAGAN.},

  abstractnote = {Deep learning has achieved a remarkable performance breakthrough in several fields, most notably in speech recognition, natural language processing, and computer vision. In particular, convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures currently produce state-of-the-art performance on a variety of image analysis tasks such as object detection and recognition. Most of deep learning research has so far focused on dealing with 1D, 2D, or 3D Euclidean-structured data such as acoustic signals, images, or videos. Recently, there has been an increasing interest in geometric deep learning, attempting to generalize deep learning methods to non-Euclidean structured data such as graphs and manifolds, with a variety of applications from the domains of network analysis, computational social science, or computer graphics. In this paper, we propose a unified framework allowing to generalize CNN architectures to non-Euclidean domains (graphs and manifolds) and learn local, stationary, and compositional task-specific features. We show that various non-Euclidean CNN methods previously proposed in the literature can be considered as particular instances of our framework. We test the proposed method on standard tasks from the realms of image-, graph-and 3D shape analysis and show that it consistently outperforms previous approaches.},

  title        = {A Generalization of Transformer Networks to Graphs},
  url          = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.09699},
  abstractnote = {We propose a generalization of transformer neural network architecture for arbitrary graphs. The original transformer was designed for Natural Language Processing (NLP), which operates on fully connected graphs representing all connections between the words in a sequence. Such architecture does not leverage the graph connectivity inductive bias, and can perform poorly when the graph topology is important and has not been encoded into the node features. We introduce a graph transformer with four new properties compared to the standard model. First, the attention mechanism is a function of the neighborhood connectivity for each node in the graph. Second, the positional encoding is represented by the Laplacian eigenvectors, which naturally generalize the sinusoidal positional encodings often used in NLP. Third, the layer normalization is replaced by a batch normalization layer, which provides faster training and better generalization performance. Finally, the architecture is extended to edge feature representation, which can be critical to tasks s.a. chemistry (bond type) or link prediction (entity relationship in knowledge graphs). Numerical experiments on a graph benchmark demonstrate the performance of the proposed graph transformer architecture. This work closes the gap between the original transformer, which was designed for the limited case of line graphs, and graph neural networks, that can work with arbitrary graphs. As our architecture is simple and generic, we believe it can be used as a black box for future applications that wish to consider transformer and graphs.},

  abstractnote = {Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved great success on grid-like data such as images, but face tremendous challenges in learning from more generic data such as graphs. In CNNs, the trainable local filters enable the automatic extraction of high-level features. The computation with filters requires a fixed number of ordered units in the receptive fields. However, the number of neighboring units is neither fixed nor are they ordered in generic graphs, thereby hindering the applications of convolutional operations. Here, we address these challenges by proposing the learnable graph convolutional layer (LGCL). LGCL automatically selects a fixed number of neighboring nodes for each feature based on value ranking in order to transform graph data into grid-like structures in 1-D format, thereby enabling the use of regular convolutional operations on generic graphs. To enable model training on large-scale graphs, we propose a sub-graph training method to reduce the excessive memory and computational resource requirements suffered by prior methods on graph convolutions. Our experimental results on node classification tasks in both transductive and inductive learning settings demonstrate that our methods can achieve consistently better performance on the Cora, Citeseer, Pubmed citation network, and protein-protein interaction network datasets. Our results also indicate that the proposed methods using sub-graph training strategy are more efficient as compared to prior approaches.},

  abstractnote = {Rumor detection is an important research topic in social networks, and lots of rumor detection models are proposed in recent years. For the rumor detection task, structural information in a conversation can be used to extract effective features. However, many existing rumor detection models focus on local structural features while the global structural features between the source tweet and its replies are not effectively used. To make full use of global structural features and content information, we propose SourceReplies relation Graph (SR-graph) for each conversation, in which every node denotes a tweet, its node feature is weighted word vectors, and edges denote the interaction between tweets. Based on SR-graphs, we propose an Ensemble Graph Convolutional Neural Net with a Nodes Proportion Allocation Mechanism (EGCN) for the rumor detection task. In experiments, we ﬁrst verify that the extracted structural features are effective, and then we show the effects of different word-embedding dimensions on multiple test indices. Moreover, we show that our proposed EGCN model is comparable or even better than the current state-of-art machine learning models.},

We deﬁne the trafﬁc graph convolution based on the physical network topology. The relationship between the proposed trafﬁc graph convolution and the spectral graph convolution is also discussed. An L1-norm on graph convolution weights and an L2-norm on graph convolution features are added to the model’s loss function to enhance the interpretability of the proposed model. Experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms baseline methods on two real-world trafﬁc state datasets. The visualization of the graph convolution weights indicates that the proposed framework can recognize the most inﬂuential road segments in real-world trafﬁc networks.},
