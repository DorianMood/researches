	abstract = {Wind speed prediction and forecasting is important for various business and management sectors. In this paper, we introduce new models for wind speed prediction based on graph convolutional networks (GCNs). Given hourly data of several weather variables acquired from multiple weather stations, wind speed values are predicted for multiple time steps ahead. In particular, the weather stations are treated as nodes of a graph whose associated adjacency matrix is learnable. In this way, the network learns the graph spatial structure and determines the strength of relations between the weather stations based on the historical weather data. We add a self-loop connection to the learnt adjacency matrix and normalize the adjacency matrix. We examine two scenarios with the self-loop connection setting (two separate models). In the first scenario, the self-loop connection is imposed as a constant additive. In the second scenario a learnable parameter is included to enable the network to decide about the self-loop connection strength. Furthermore, we incorporate data from multiple time steps with temporal convolution, which together with spatial graph convolution constitutes spatio-temporal graph convolution. We perform experiments on real datasets collected from weather stations located in cities in Denmark and the Netherlands. The numerical experiments show that our proposed models outperform previously developed baseline models on the referenced datasets. We provide additional insights by visualizing learnt adjacency matrices from each layer of our models.},

	abstract = {Multiple object tracking is to give each object an id in the video. The difficulty is how to match the predicted objects and detected objects in same frames. Matching features include appearance features, location features, etc. These features of the predicted object are basically based on some previous frames. However, few papers describe the relationship in the time domain between the previous frame features and the current frame features.In this paper, we proposed a time domain graph convolutional network for multiple objects tracking.The model is mainly divided into two parts, we first use convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract pedestrian appearance feature, which is a normal operation processing image in deep learning, then we use GCN to model some past frames' appearance feature to get the prediction appearance feature of the current frame. Due to this extension, we can get the pose features of the current frame according to the relationship between some frames in the past. Experimental evaluation shows that our extensions improve the MOTA by 1.3 on the MOT16, achieving overall competitive performance at high frame rates.},

	abstract = {Graph signal processing (GSP) have found many applications in different domains. The underlying graph may not be available in all applications, and it should be learned from the data. There exist complicated data, where the graph changes over time. Hence, it is necessary to estimate the dynamic graph. In this paper, a new dynamic graph learning algorithm, called dynamic K -graphs, is proposed. This algorithm is capable of both estimating the time-varying graph and clustering the temporal graph signals. Numerical experiments demonstrate the high performance of this algorithm compared with other algorithms.},

	abstract = {The construction of a meaningful graph topology plays a crucial role in the effective representation, processing, analysis and visualization of structured data. When a natural choice of the graph is not readily available from the data sets, it is thus desirable to infer or learn a graph topology from the data. In this tutorial overview, we survey solutions to the problem of graph learning, including classical viewpoints from statistics and physics, and more recent approaches that adopt a graph signal processing (GSP) perspective. We further emphasize the conceptual similarities and differences between classical and GSP-based graph inference methods, and highlight the potential advantage of the latter in a number of theoretical and practical scenarios. We conclude with several open issues and challenges that are keys to the design of future signal processing and machine learning algorithms for learning graphs from data.},
